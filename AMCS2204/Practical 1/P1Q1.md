**Summary of Scanner and `new` keyword:**

**1. Scanner basics:**

- `Scanner` is a class (blueprint) that reads input
- You must tell it WHERE to read from: `Scanner(System.in)` means keyboard

**2. What `new` does:**

- `new` initializes/creates the actual Scanner object in memory
- Sets up all internal machinery so it can actually work
- Without `new`, you just have an empty variable that points to nothing

**3. The full line:**

```java
Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
```

- `Scanner` = data type
- `scnr` = variable name (you chose this)
- `new` = creates the actual object
- `Scanner(System.in)` = initialize it to read from keyboard

**4. When to use `new`:**

- Use for objects (Scanner, ArrayList, File, etc.)
- DON'T use for primitives (int, double, boolean)
- DON'T use for string literals (`String name = "text"`)

**5. Why you need it:** Without `new`, the object doesn't exist. You can't call methods like `.nextLine()` on something that doesn't exist.

**Bottom line:** `new` builds and initializes objects so they're ready to use.
