## 1) Internet Access Technologies
There are many ways to connect users and organizations to the internet:
- Popular services for home users and small offices include:
	- [[Broadband cable]]
	- [[Digital subscriber line (DSL)]]
	- Wireless [[WAN]]s
	- Mobile services
-  Organizations need faster connections to support IP phones, video conferencing and data center storage.
- Business-Class interconnections are usually provided by service providers and may include:
	- [[Business DSL]]
	- [[Leased lines]]
	- [[Metro Ethernet]]

## 2)Home and Small Office Internet Connections

| Connection                        | Description                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cable                             | High bandwidth, always on                                        |
| [[Digital subscriber line (DSL)]] | High bandwidth, always on, runs over a telephone line            |
| Cellular                          | Uses a cell phone network to connect to the internet.            |
| Satellite                         | Major benefit to rural areas without Internet Service Providers. |
| Dial-up telephone                 | An inexpensive, low bandwidth option using a modem.              |

## 3)Business Internet Connections
Corporate business connections may require:
- High bandwidth
- Dedicated connections
- Managed services

| Type of Connection        | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Dedicated Leased Line]] | Reserved circuits within the service provider's network that connect distant offices with private voice and/or data networking. |
| Ethernet [[WAN]]          | This extends LAN access technology into the WAN                                                                                 |
| DSL                       | Business DSL is available in various formats including Symmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (SDSL)                                |
| Satellite                 | This can provide a connection when a wired solution is not available                                                            |

## 4) Traditional Separate Networks ([[Last Year Midterm]])
- Before converged networks, an organization would have been separately cabled for telephone, video and data.
- Each of these networks used different technologies to carry the signals.
- Each of these technologies would use a different set of rules and standards.

## 5) The Converging Network
- Converged data networks carry multiple services on one link including:
	- Data
	- Voice
	- Video
- Converged networks can deliver data, voice and video over the same network infrastructure.
- The network infrastructure uses the same set of rules and standards.
