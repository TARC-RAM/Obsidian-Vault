## 1)Network Representations 
Network Diagrams, often called topology diagrams, use symbols to represent devices within the network.

**Network Interface Cards** - Provides the physical connection to the network at the PC or other end device. The media connecting the PC to the networking device plugs directly into the NIC.

Physical Port - A connector or outlet on a networking device where the media is connected to a host or other networking device. 

Interface - Specialized ports on an inter-networking device that connect to individual networks. Because routers are used to interconnect networks, the **ports on a router are referred to [[NETWORK INTERFACES]]

## 2)Topology Diagrams
[[Physical topology diagrams]] illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation.

[[Logical topology diagrams]] illustrate the devices, ports and the addressing scheme of the network.
