# Network Components
## 1) Host Roles
Every computer on a network is called a HOST or END DEVICE.

Servers are computers that provide information to end device:
- [[Email Servers]]
- [[Web Servers]]
- [[File Servers]] 
Clients are computers that send requests to servers to retrieve information:
- Web page from a web server
- Email from an email server

## 2)Peer-to-Peer
A Device can be a CLIENT and a SERVER in a Peer-to-Peer Network.
Only recommended for very small networks.

| Advantages            | Disadvantages                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Easy to set up        | No [[centralized administration]] |
| Less complex          | Not as secure                     |
| Lower cost            | Not scalable                      |
| Used for simple tasks | Can slow performance              |

## 3)End Devices/Host
An End Device is **where the message comes from or where it goes to**.
Data starts at an End Device, flows through the network and arrives at an end device.

## 4)Intermediary Network Devices
Intermediary device interconnects [[End Devices]].
Examples:
- Wireless Router
- LAN Switch
- Router
- Multi-layer Switch
- Firewall Appliance
Management of data as it flows through a network is also the role of intermediary devices, including:
- Regenerate and retransmit data signals.
- Maintain information about what pathways exist in the network.
- Notify other devices of errors and communication failures.

## 5)[[Network Media]]
Communication across a network is carried through a medium which allows a message to travel from source to destination.

| Media Types                                               | Description                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metal wires in cables                                     | Uses Electrical impulses                                          |
| Glass or plastic fibers in cables <br>(Fiber-Optic cable) | Uses Pulses of light                                              |
| Wireless transmission                                     | Uses Modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves. |
