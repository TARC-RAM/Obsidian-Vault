The SDLC starts from a 'System Request'.
It may be a formal (a form) or informal (eg oral instruction) request.

- Purpose - Request for services (i.e develop a new system) from the IS department to solve problems.
- Reasons for a system request
	- Existing system cannot support the new organisation's business objectives.
	- Existing system has problems, errors or lacking in some functions, leading to not able to support some business processes.
# Sources of System Request
1) From Top Management - Instruction to improve on existing system to meet management's requirements.
	- New reports needed.
	- New organisational objectives such as Increase sales or needs new modules such as CRM system.
	- New departmental functions such as customer service needs new modules.
2) From Users - Users need for new features to support new roles or to solve existing system problems.
	- New features required for inward returns (Inventory system)
	- New requirements to support new job roles in sales
3) From Existing System Problems - Errors or inefficiencies within existing systems are reported (by users) or observed (by IS personnel)
	- Poor system performance such as slow loading times due to needing to support more users
4) From External Sources  - Outside forces may influence the pressure for changes to existing systems.
	- Technology - New advances in technology put pressure to develop new systems (i.e ERP system, RFID)
	- Regulations - New government tax regulations requires changes be made to the payroll system
	- Customers - new requirements by important customers who demands online sales feature
5) From IS Department - IS departments own recommendations for projects
	- IS personnel discovered poor performance of the existing system
	-  IS Personnel found lots of errors and bugs
# Types of Improvement Required
1) Improve performance - The current system might not perform as well as it must.
	- Reports taking too long to prepare
	- System cannot support increasing numbers of users
	- Transactions take a long time to complete
2) Improve functions - Improving functions of the system to both the internal customers and external customers.
	- Simplifying overtime claims process for staff.
	- Improving share registration process for customers.
	- Add new functionalities to the system such as create [[RFQ]] (Request for Quoatation)
	- Providing customers with up to date product brochures.
3) Improve Quality of Reports - Information produced might be inadequate, incomplete, not timely or available.
	- Reports produced are not : accurate, complete, relevant, useful, timely
4) Create Effective Controls - Controls might be inadequate or excessive
	- Inadequate - Weak system access or log control leads to security problem
	- Excessive - Data input control might be too excessive (i.e limit checks) (uppoer or lower) slows down transaction.
5) Reduce Costs - Operation and maintenance costs in the current system are too high.
	- Operation - Existing system and the department operation cost is high (i.e cumbersome purchasing process) (create PO, RFQ, Q) require lots of manpower.
	- Maintenance - Existing system has lots of bugs, lack functions and features, lack documentation
# Preliminary Investigation
- When - After a system project has been approved
- Purpose - Gather information to determine if problems specified in the systems request warrant conducting subsequent phase of SDLC ie System Analysis.
- Areas Involved:
	- Investigate about the system requested.
	- Determining the true nature and scope of the problem (system requested).
	- Output - Preliminary Investigation Report to management for approval
# Feasibility Study
To determine whether the new system is practical or feasible.
For example:
- Whether the new system is economically justifiable, benefits outweigh the cost of developing and implementing the solution
- Socially and operationally viable
# Types of Feasibility Study
1) Technical Feasibility
	- Specifying the **HARDWARE**, **SOFTWARE** and **HUMAN** requirements of the application system under study.
	- Evaluating whether the above requirements are technically achievable
	- Issues to be addressed
		- Number of Users - Ability to support increased number of users.
		- Data inputs - The ability to accurately enter and process a large number of inputs, such as examination marks
		- Response Time - The ability to provide a response to a request (i.e request from a customer for an insurance quotation) as soon as possible
		- Outputs - The ability to produce certain outputs, such as examination results by a certain deadline.
2) Social and Operation Feasibility
	- Assessing whether the project can be implemented into the existing social and operational structure of the organization.
	- Identifying any additional costs that may be incurred (eg. cost of staff re-training, redundancies) or new benefits.
	- Issues to be addressed
		- Employee training - The new system may require new skills and attitudes.
		- Employee motivation and morale - Likely job changes caused by the system and how these might affect the motivation or resistance of employees.
		- Organisational Structural changes - Changes in management responsibilities, relationships, status and chains of command, or does not suit regional reporting structures.
		- High costs - Asses direct (redundancies, retraining) and indirect (eg. in terms of morale and motivation of remaining staff) costs.
3) Economic Feasibility
	- Identify and quantify the various cost and benefits of implementing proposed system.
	- Evaluating the various project options using suitable techniques (eg. ROI, payback)
	- Issues to be addressed
		- Technique - Using the correct technique to compare costs and benefits
		- Selection - Determine which of the technical options under consideration the company should choose.
		- Decision - Making decision whether to continue or halt the project

# Intangible Costs
- Learning curve costs - Staff need to learn how the system operates. During the learning curve, staff become slower and make more mistakes.
- Dysfunctional costs - Staff dissatisfaction and dysfunctional behavior eg. scolding customers, come late
- Incompatibility costs - Cost of incompatibility between existing systems and the new system.
  For example, replacing old system or build a new special data file conversion facility.
- Opportunity costs - Whenever money is invested in one area, the opportunity to invest in another area is gone.
# Tangible/Quantifiable Benefits
- Reduced operating costs - Due to streamlining of processes, reduced office space.
- Reduced Staff costs - Reduced number of staff required
- Reduced stock costs - Through up-to-date information eg reduce stock holding costs.
