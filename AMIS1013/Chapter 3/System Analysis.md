## Definition of System Analysis (Requirements Analysis)
- Objectives - Defining the required (functionalities) of the new system
- Document - These requirements are usually collated in a list (System Requirements Specification)
- Fact-Gathering Techniques - The analyst will use fact-finding techniques such as interviewing, document analysis and questionnaires.
- Fact-Recording Techniques - The documented facts will be written and/or modeled using such techniques as narrative description, DFD and ERD
## Fact Gathering in System Development
- From whom - From people who will be using the system i.e mainly from end users.
- Quality of Analyst - The analyst must have (knowledge), *skills* and be *experienced* in the business area eg. business rules and processed involved, and interviewing skills.
- What to gather - Business rules, (processes), environment of work, activities of users, and system interfaces with other systems, inputs, outputs and (data) stores (files).
# Technique of Fact Gathering
## Fact Gathering
- Methods - Many methods to gather facts (user's requirements) eg. interviewing
- (Business) functions - A company has many departments and each has its department functions.
- (System) functions - Each system has its system functions used to support its business processes
- (Business process) - A process consists of activities or tasks, carried out by system and/or people.
### 1. Interviews
- Widely used technique and the most productive.
- Ask the user (questions) on how the current system works and about requirements.
- Formal meetings (with agenda, objectives)
- Documented feedback to the user for confirmation
# Advantages of Interviews
- Overcome Resistance - Provides an opportunity to meet and overcome user resistance. It gets cooperation of people involved.
- (Body language) - Interviews allow the analyst to observe the tone of the responses and body language which convey great deal of information.
- (Clarify) Facts - Face-to-face interview allows the interviewer to verify and clarify the confusing facts.
- Build (Rapport) - Opportunity to develop rapport with users and to seek cooperation.
- (Intimate) and Frank - People who would be unwilling to put critical or controversial comments in writing talk more freely in person.
# Disadvantages of Interviews
- (Costly) and Time-consuming - An interview requires the dedicated time of both the interviewer and the interviewee for the duration of the interview.
- Require (Skills) - Certain amount of skill is required on the part of the interviewer and interviewing is an art not readily acquired.
- Require Personal Contacts - Personal contacts are important in getting the cooperation of the people involved.
# 2. Questionnaires
1) Meaning
   - Users are (sent) some questionnaires about the current system for them to answer at their leisure time.
   - A (mix) of closed questions (to ascertain facts) and open questions (to describe feelings and opinions).
   - Can be checked and tested before sending them to the users to respond.
   - May represent a first stage of data collection to be supported by later follow-on interviews.
1) Circumstances Suitable
   - For large number of users (respondents) - There may be insufficient time to interview all the possible users of the system and therefore a sample is take.
   - For geographically (distributed) users - It is time-consuming and expensive to interview users who are widely geographically distributed.
   - For (sensitive) Issues - Useful in circumstances where the provided of the information wants to remain anonymous for sensitive issues.
   - For facts gathering which (takes time) - Factual information requires the user to investigate rather than respond with instant answers as in interviews.
## Example of Questionnaires
- Focus on a particular issue or problem or objective
- Inventory System
	- Problem/Issue : Lack of useful reports in the inventory system.
	- Questions:
		- What are the reports which are produced by the present system?
		- What do you think are some of the reports which are missing but could be useful in your decision making?
		- Describe each of the reports you would like to have: title, content, who use, purpose.
		- How would each of these reports, which you have suggested, help you in your decision making?
		- Do functions and features in the system available allow you to create your own reports?
		- Have you been trained to use the system, particularly on the reporting functions and features.
		- What do you think are the reasons why the system cannot produce the reports that you want?
# Advantages of Questionnaires
- Recipient Answer at (Convenient) Time - The recipients can answer questionnaires at their convenience; it isn't necessary to set aside a significant block of time as one must do for an interview.
- Respond (Anonymously) - The questionnaire can be used to provide anonymous responses. There is evidence to suggest that respondents are more likely to give more accurate responses this way.
- Respondent (Given Time) - The respondent is given time to assemble the required information.
- Gather Information from Large Group - Questionnaires may be used where the respondents are relatively many and geographically dispersed.
# Disadvantages of Questionnaires
- (Difficult) to Design - Difficult to formulate or design the questions so that no misinterpretation is possible and no bias is possible in the replies.
- Cannot (clarify) Questions - One cannot clarify the questions as you can in an interview.
- Not all forms will be (returned) - Many people object to filling in forms while others delay completing them until they are eventually forgotten.
# 3. Observation - Meaning
- Objectives - An analyst would watch who interrelates with whom in a dept and procedures.
- (Arrangement) - Make arrangements and make everyone aware of the purpose of your visit
- Items observed - Observe how data flows, from desk to desk or computer to computer. Note how data comes into and leaves the organisation.
- Method - Participatory observation; in this method the analyst temporarily joins the activities of the group.
# Advantages of Observation
- Additional Perspective - Seeing the system in action gives you an additional perspective to supplement what you have heard (interview) and read (inspection)
- (Environmental) Conditions - Allows the analyst to observe environmental conditions (such as dirt, space and noise) which may affect implementation.
- (Cross-check) and Verify - Provides the opportunity for the analyst to cross-check and verify information given in an interview.
- Acquire New Know-how - Personal observation helps you acquire the know-how you will need for implementation
- Better (Acceptance) - You also become better acquainted with the operating personnel who will be implementing the new or changed system.
# Disadvantages of Observation
- (Time) Consuming - Due to time factor, the analyst seldom carry out thorough investigation.
- Need Prior (Understanding) of Procedure - It needs the observer to have an understanding of the procedures involved for effective observation.
- Need Power of (Concentration) - Good observation is very difficult to develop. Much depends on power of concentration. Easily distracted.
- Subconscious Observation - An analyst will tend to make subconscious observations of his local environment based on past experiences.
- Hawthorne Effect - Workers might be nervous under observation. Therefore may not accurately represent the real situation.
# 4. Analysis of Existing Documents
- (Collect) - The analyst will collect a number of relevant documents used in the current system.
- (Copy) - Make copies or samples of relevant documents. Examples: reports, organisation charts, procedures, manuals etc.
- Analyse - Make analysis of the documents to understand the problems and processes.
# 5. Joint Application Development (JAD)
- Forum - JAD is a (workshop) for users in exploring requirements, issues and problems.
- Purpose - Allows IT personnel to work with users as a group to learn about their requirements through (group discussions)
- Participants - Headed by a project leader who has various skills eg. organisational interpersonal, technical (eg CASE tools)
- Documentation Proceedings of the workshop are recorded.
# 6. Background Research
- When to Use:
	- There are no expertise available for interview or questionnaires
	- No existing system and documents available for observation or inspection.
- (Methods)
	- Reviewing journals, periodicals, and books that contain information relevant to the task at hand.
	- Attending professional (meetings) and seminars.
	- Formal and informal discussions with other professional in related areas.
	- Visits to similar sites.
# 7. Prototyping Approach
- Model - A model containing key features eg data entry, or report program, is created by using a 4GL or CASE tools.
- (Purpose) - For Users to test and provide feedback as to whether it meets their requirements.
- Speed - The prototypes can be modified quickly eg using 4GL or CASE tools.
- (Productivity) - The models or prototypes can be developed into a working and complete application programs in shorter time period.
# Functional Requirements
- Refers to the (functionalities) that the system is expected to provide eg create PO (for Purchasing System).
- Described in detail (how) the functionalities are used to support a business process, activities or tasks being carried out including inputs, process, outputs and stored data.
## Example of Functional Requirements
# Sales System
- Enquiries
	- Receive & Answer enquiries
- Quotations
- Receive RFQ
- Create & send quotations
# Non-Functional Requirements
## Example 1 : Interfaces with other systems
- With other systems - There is an increasing need for applications to receive data from one system and to supply it to another.
	- Example - Payroll system with accounts system for cash flow forecasting.
- With generalized software - such as spreadsheets or specialized tools for data mining.
## Example 2 : Audit requirements
- Meaning - Most software solutions require some sort of audit trail. This trail records significant information about particular transactions.
- Example - (Payroll) system : The change of salary scale for a particular employee might be recorded on an audit trail eg. date, time of change, the previous salary scale etc.
- Agreement - the need for content of, an audit trail must be agreed with auditors and defined in the non-functional requirements.
## Example 3 : Legal issues
- Importance - The software may have to support certain legal requirements. These may be defined by industry-wide legislation, such as the Data Protection Act (in UK).
- Purpose - Legislation may place certain responsibilities on the (user); the software should support the user in fulfilling those responsibilities.
- Example - The legislation may require fields recording who provided that information and when that information was last updated etc
## Example 4 : Archiving, backup and recovery
- Backup and Recovery Routines
	- Definition - To make a copy in anticipation of future failure or corruption
	- Purpose - To  ensure that the most recent usable copy of the data can be recovered and restored in the event of loss or corruption.
	- Method - Manually or automated using software (part of OS function)
	- Intervals for Back-up - Depending on (1) nature of data and (2) nature of organization
- Archiving Facilities
	- Definition - The process of moving by copying data from primary storage, such as hard disk, to tape or other portable media for long-term storage.
	- Purpose - Provides a legally acceptable business history, while freeing up hard disk space speed up searching function.
	- Length of Retention depends on: (1) Legal obligations and (2) Other business needs.
# Example 5 : Usability
- Usability - ease with which end users can use a particular system to perform a particular business function.
- Methods used to measure:
	- (Learnability) - How long it takes a user to learn to use a particular function of the system?
	- (Memorability) - When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they remember how to use?
	- (Satisfaction) - How pleasant is it for the users to use the design?
	- Errors - How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
	- Efficiency - Once users have learned to design, how quickly can they use the system to perform tasks?
	# Example 6 : Reliability
	- Measures
		- Systems ability to perform and continue to perform its functions without failure.
		- Systems which are not reliable break down frequently.
	- Consequences 
		- System out of service brings hardship to the users and others eg. customers.
	- Reasons for not being reliable
		- Insufficient testing
		- Poor design
	- Important in some industries
		- Life-support systems
		- Attack and defend systems
